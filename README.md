# **INTRODUCTION**
This dataset contains information about bank customers and their churn status, indicating whether they have exited the bank. It is useful for analyzing factors influencing customer churn and for building predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving, helping banks enhance customer retention strategies.


# **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
Customer churn is a critical concern for banks, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By analyzing the factors that lead to customer churn, banks can develop targeted strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Understanding and predicting churn allows banks to implement proactive measures, such as personalized offers and improved customer service, to reduce churn rates and enhance overall profitability. This analysis not only aids in identifying at-risk customers but also in optimizing marketing efforts and resource allocation to maximize customer retention.


# **DATA UNDERSTANDING**
This dataset offers a detailed view of bank customers and their churn status, indicating whether they have left the bank. It includes demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes of the customers. Analyzing this data helps in identifying factors influencing customer churn, which is essential for building predictive models to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

**Target Variable:**

Exited: Indicates whether the customer has exited the bank (binary: yes/no).

**Unique Identifier:**

CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer.

**Features:**

RowNumber: The sequential number assigned to each row in the dataset.

Surname: The surname of the customer.

CreditScore: The credit score of the customer.

Geography: The geographical location of the customer (e.g., country or region).

Gender: The gender of the customer.

Age: The age of the customer.

Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.

Balance: The account balance of the customer.

NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer has.

HasCrCard: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card (binary: yes/no).

IsActiveMember: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (binary: yes/no).

EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.


# **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
The primary goal is to identify the key factors that influence customer churn in a banking institution and develop a predictive model to accurately identify customers at risk of leaving. By leveraging the dataset's demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes, we aim to provide actionable insights and strategies for improving customer retention and minimizing churn rates.


# **OBJECTIVES**
**Main Objective**

Develop and Optimize Classification Models:

Build, train, and fine-tune classification models to accurately predict customer churn, evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.

**Specific Objectives**

- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of various features and identify patterns associated with customer churn.


- Generate Insights and Recommendations:

Interpret the results of the analysis and models to provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer retention.



### Recommendations

- **Enhance Product Offerings**: Focus on increasing the number of products per customer to improve retention.
  
- **Engage Active Members**: Develop strategies to keep members active and engaged.
  
- **Target Specific Demographics**: Tailor retention strategies based on age and geographic location.
  
- **Improve Customer Experience**: Focus on high-tenure and gender-specific needs to enhance satisfaction.




### Next Steps 

- **Customer Engagement Programs**: Develop and launch targeted retention campaigns based on model insights.
  
- **Training and Support**: Provide training sessions for staff on using the new predictive model and interpreting its outputs.
  
- **Communication Strategy**: Communicate the benefits of the predictive model to stakeholders and customers to ensure buy-in.
  
- **Monitor Impact**: Regularly review the impact of retention strategies on customer churn rates and adjust accordingly.
